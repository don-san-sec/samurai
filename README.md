# Samurai - Gmail Phishing Reporter

<img alt="" src=".github/media/logo.png" width=100 align="right">

A simple Gmail add-on that helps users report suspicious emails to their security team with one click. When a user reports an email, it's automatically forwarded as an .eml attachment to the security team, preserving all headers for forensic analysis.

## Features

- **Two reporting options**:
  - **Report Phishing** - Alert security team about suspicious emails (no response expected)
  - **Request Investigation** - Ask security team to investigate and respond back
- **Full email preservation** - Emails are forwarded as .eml attachments with all headers intact
- **Clean reports** - Security team receives structured reports with key information highlighted
- **No external dependencies** - Runs entirely within Google Workspace
- **Minimal permissions** - Only requests necessary Gmail access
